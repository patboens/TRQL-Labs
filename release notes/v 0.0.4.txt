Change Log v 0.0.4
==================

1) APIHandler shares the "apigateway" namespace with SmallAPIGW

3) APIHandler process : documented with (almost) real example

4) SmallAPIGW (trql.smallAPIGW.class.php) uses the "apigateway" namespace

5) Files where class aliases are declared (e.g. "use \trql\vaesoli\Vaesoli as v;")
   now have this reflected in their documentation

5) Multiple classes whose "use" mentioned obsolete namespaces have been
   fixed according to the new namespace universe set for the TRQL Labs
   classes. Future adaptations may need to be necessary. Better testing
   is highly desirable.
