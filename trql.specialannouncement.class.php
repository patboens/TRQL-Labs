    {*purpose               A SpecialAnnouncement combines a simple date-stamped textual
                            information update with contextualized Web links and other
                            structured data. It represents an information update made by
                            a locally-oriented organization, for example schools,
                            pharmacies, healthcare providers, community groups, police,
                            local government.For work in progress guidelines on
                            Coronavirus-related markup see this doc.The motivating
                            scenario for SpecialAnnouncement is the Coronavirus
                            pandemic, and the initial vocabulary is oriented to this
                            urgent situation. Schema.orgexpect to improve the markup
                            iteratively as it is deployed and as feedback emerges from
                            use. In addition to ourusual Github entry, feedback comments
                            can also be provided in this document.While this schema is
                            designed to communicate urgent crisis-related information,
                            it is not the same as an emergency warning technology like
                            CAP, although there may be overlaps. The intent is to
                            coverthe kinds of everyday practical information being
                            posted to existing websites during an emergency
                            situation.Several kinds of information can be provided:We
                            encourage the provision of "name", "text", "datePosted",
                            "expires" (if appropriate), "category" and"url" as a simple
                            baseline. It is important to provide a value for "category"
                            where possible, most ideally as a well knownURL from
                            Wikipedia or Wikidata. In the case of the 2019-2020
                            Coronavirus pandemic, this should be
                            "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2019-20coronaviruspandemic"
                            or "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81068910".For many of the
                            possible properties, values can either be simple links or an
                            inline description, depending on whether a summary is
                            available. For a link, provide just the URL of the
                            appropriate page as the property's value. For an inline
                            description, use a WebContent type, and provide the url as a
                            property of that, alongside at least a simple "text" summary
                            of the page. It isunlikely that a single SpecialAnnouncement
                            will need all of the possible properties simultaneously.We
                            expect that in many cases the page referenced might contain
                            more specialized structured data, e.g. contact info,
                            openingHours, Event, FAQPage etc. By linking to those pages
                            from a SpecialAnnouncement you can help make it clearer that
                            the events are related to the situation (e.g. Coronavirus)
                            indicated by the category property of the
                            SpecialAnnouncement.Many SpecialAnnouncements will relate to
                            particular regions and to identifiable local organizations.
                            Use spatialCoverage for the region, and announcementLocation
                            to indicate specific LocalBusinesses and CivicStructures. If
                            the announcement affects both a particular region and a
                            specific location (for example, a library closure that
                            serves an entire region), use both spatialCoverage and
                            announcementLocation.The about property can be used to
                            indicate entities that are the focus of the announcement. We
                            now recommend using about onlyfor representing non-location
                            entities (e.g. a Course or a RadioStation). For places, use
                            announcementLocation and spatialCoverage. Consumers of this
                            markup should be aware that the initial design encouraged
                            the use of /about for locations too.The basic content of
                            SpecialAnnouncement is similar to that of an RSS or Atom
                            feed. For publishers without such feeds, basic feed-like
                            information can be shared by postingSpecialAnnouncement
                            updates in a page, e.g. using JSON-LD. For sites with
                            Atom/RSS functionality, you can point to a feedwith the
                            webFeed property. This can be a simple URL, or an inline
