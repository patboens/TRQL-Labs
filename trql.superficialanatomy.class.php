                            body as well as surface landmarks that correspond to deeper
                            subcutaneous structures. Superficial anatomy plays an
                            important role in sports medicine, phlebotomy, and other
                            medical specialties as underlying anatomical structures can
                            be identified through surface palpation. For example, during
                            back surgery, superficial anatomy can be used to palpate and
                            count vertebrae to find the site of incision. Or in
                            phlebotomy, superficial anatomy can be used to locate an
                            underlying vein; for example, the median cubital vein can be
                            located by palpating the borders of the cubital fossa (such
                            as the epicondyles of the humerus) and then looking for the
                            superficial signs of the vein, such as size, prominence,
                            ability to refill after depression, and feel of surrounding
                            tissue support. As another example, in a subluxation
                            (dislocation) of the glenohumeral joint, the bony structure
                            becomes pronounced with the deltoid muscle failing to cover
                            the glenohumeral joint allowing the edges of the scapula to
                            be superficially visible. Here, the superficial anatomy is
                            the visible edges of the scapula, implying the underlying
